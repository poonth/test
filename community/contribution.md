# Contribution

AMDC values Alkie Monks’ comments and suggestions. Their contribution is key to forming a healthy community within AMDC as well as development of AMDC in the long run. In addition to the usual chat function on Discord, Alkie Monks are encouraged to actively **make recommendations** and **share news of any up-and-coming drinks** in the Discord community. \
\
AMDC will regularly organise tasting events (virtual/in person) based on the community’s **recommendations** and **voting** results. The main goal of community contribution is allowing Alkie Monks to decide AMDC’s very own **exclusive product(s)** through tasting events and polls.
