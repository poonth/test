# Use of Treasury

To keep the transparency of the treasury fund, a treasury wallet will be set up and announced after the 1st Minting Phase. Any fund to be extracted from the treasury will be announced and explained before any action to be taken. The team will also provide a monthly update to the AMDC community on the status of the treasury, i.e. royalty income, profit and loss from the product sale and expense details.
